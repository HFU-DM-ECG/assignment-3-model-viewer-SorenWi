## Explanation
The scene contains 3 different material types (Water, Crystals, Terrain), with a vertex and fragment shader each.
All materials use shadow mapping to display received shadows. Shadows are applied by lerping to a darker version of the color based on the shadow value. The terrain material also uses diffused lighting. A directional light that can be moved in the gui is used as a light source. 

Crystals have a base color with an additive fresnel effect.

The terrain uses the dot product of the normal and the up vector to determin the color.

For the water a depth texture excluding the water is rendered. This depth texture is used to compare the scene depth to the (fragments) depth of the water to calculate intersections and apply a different color and alpha value based on the depth. Two noise textures with a different scale are used to give the water more detail. The UVs of the water objects are set up and used as a flow map where -y is the flow direction.
